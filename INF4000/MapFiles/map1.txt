#Kenji$This can't be... I can't let vile rebels harm my natal village. If only I had my father's courage, maybe we could stand a chance against them.
#Himiko$Kenji! You have to save Hamura from the rebels. Think about all the great memories we made growing up in this village. 
#Himiko$I know what it is to try and live to your father's  exepectation. Even if he's far away, You can make him proud, by chasing these rebels. I belive in you!
#Kenji$Himiko... I will do my best for you, for my father, and for those poor souls trapped in this village.
#Gohzu$Hahaha! Try all you want kiddo, thses puny peasants aren't going anywhere aside from their tombs!
#Gohzu$Come, rush at us if you want, your troops and you don't stand a chance!
#Kenji$We will see about that Gozhu. Bring it on!

#Gohzu$This can't be..! Defeated by a kid and a bunch of peasants, I... deserve... death...
#Kenji$I take no pride in what I did today but I am glad that these inocent villagers are safe for now
#Himiko$You've always been so humble Kenji. I knew you would succeed and that you had it in you to lead an army with such determination.
#Himiko$By the powers confered to me and my title, I make you, Kenji Namate, General of the Elisian Army.
#Himiko$You will now have more troops at your disposal for the battles to come and I know you will guide them well, just as your father once did.
#Kenji$It is an honor to serve you my Queen... my Friend.  I'll do everything in my power to help the Elisian Kingdom.
#Himiko$Then you must depart at once for the Koramian border where the enemy is gathering. There is also wind that your father has been seen there alive...
